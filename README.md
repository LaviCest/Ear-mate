# Ear-mate
Ear-mate is an iOS app having a purpose to support hard-of-hearing(deaf) people.
# How we built this app
We used Apple's speech framework for Swift. 
By using the speech recognition functionality, we were able to build a program that can hear voices from others and can be shown as text.
# What does the app do?
When the user starts Ear-mate, the app automatically starts to receive audio and whenever a greeting word (We used the keyword such as hello, hey, yo, etc) is called, the phone vibrates to make sure the hard-of-hearing person is able to know someone is calling him/her. 
Right after vibration, Ear-mate translates people's voices to text and this allows the user to notice what the person was saying after the greeting word. Additionally, the user can start the voice-to-text translator and end the voice-to-text translator whenever he/she wants. By utilizing this app, every hard-of-hearing people can easily know what other people are saying.
